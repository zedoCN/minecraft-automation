# Contributing to Minecraft Automation

Thanks for your interest in improving Minecraft Automation! This document explains the project layout,
the multi-version build, and how to get a change merged.

## Project layout

```
mcpfabric/
├─ build.gradle              # per-version mod build (applied to every version node)
├─ stonecutter.gradle        # Stonecutter controller (active version, chiseled tasks)
├─ settings.gradle           # declares the version nodes
├─ gradle.properties         # shared build config (loom/loader/mod version)
├─ versions/<mc>/gradle.properties   # per-version Minecraft + Fabric API versions
├─ src/main/java/…           # common code (runs on client and dedicated server)
├─ src/client/java/…         # client-only code (bot control, vision, navigation)
└─ mcp-server/               # TypeScript MCP server that talks to the in-game bridge
```

## Multi-version with Stonecutter

The mod targets many Minecraft versions from a single source tree using
[Stonecutter](https://stonecutter.kikugie.dev/). Each supported version is a *node* declared in
`settings.gradle`; all nodes share `src/`, and per-version API differences are expressed with
Stonecutter comments.

### Building

```bash
# Build the currently active version (see stonecutter.gradle)
./gradlew build

# Build the primary, locally validated version
./gradlew :26.2:build

# Optional compatibility work: other version nodes are inherited, not validated by current CI
./gradlew chiseledBuild
```

Per-version jars land in `versions/<mc>/build/libs/`.

#### JDK requirements

Minecraft's required Java version differs across the range: **1.21.x needs Java 21**, the **26.x line
needs Java 25**. Loom requires the *Gradle daemon itself* to run on a JDK at least as new as the
Minecraft version being built. So:

- Building only 1.21.x: run Gradle on **JDK 21** (or newer).
- Building 26.x, or `chiseledBuild` (all versions): run Gradle on **JDK 25**, and keep a JDK 21
  installed so Gradle can target 1.21.x via toolchains. Point Gradle at JDK 25 with `JAVA_HOME` or
  `org.gradle.java.home` — you must install that JDK yourself, as the resolver below cannot
  provision the JDK the Gradle daemon runs on. The
  [foojay toolchain resolver](https://github.com/gradle/foojay-toolchains) (configured in
  `settings.gradle`) only auto-provisions the per-version *compile* toolchains.

### Version-conditional code

Use Stonecutter comments to fork code by Minecraft version. The condition is a semver range
compared against the node being built:

```java
//? if >=1.21.2 {
p.getInventory().setSelectedSlot(slot);
//?} else
/*p.getInventory().selected = slot;*/
```

Keep the *active* (uncommented) branch targeting the newest supported version, and put older-API
fallbacks in the commented branch. Prefer narrow conditions tied to the exact version where an API
changed. When you bump or add a version, run `./gradlew chiseledBuild` and fix any node that fails
to compile.

### Adding a new Minecraft version

1. Add the version to the `versions(...)` list in `settings.gradle`.
2. Create `versions/<mc>/gradle.properties` with `minecraft_version`, `fabric_api_version`,
   `minecraft_dep`, and `java_version` (look up the Fabric API build on Modrinth and the required
   Java version in the Mojang version manifest).
3. Run `./gradlew :<mc>:build` and add Stonecutter conditionals for any compile error.

## MCP server

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

`src/tools.ts` is the single source of truth for the tool catalogue. When you add or rename a Java
RPC handler, keep the corresponding tool entry in sync.

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused; one logical change per PR.
- Match the surrounding code style (tabs in Java, the existing formatting in TypeScript).
- Make sure `./gradlew :26.2:build` and `npm run typecheck` pass. Run the MCP tests for behavioral changes; report compile, automated-test, and in-game results separately.
- Describe what you changed and which Minecraft versions you tested against.
